# NetMedicine

A lightweight, reproducible pipeline for network-based target discovery and transcriptome-guided drug prioritization in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

What this repository contains

code/01.GCN analysis and gene modules/ – Build gene co-expression networks and detect disease modules (e.g., top-1% absolute correlations, community detection, cross-cohort module consistency).

code/02. Network centrality analysis and …/ – Prioritize targets with multi-criteria scoring.

code/03.drug discovery/ – Construct gene-centered disease signatures and run LINCS/L1000 connectivity mapping to rank candidate compounds.
